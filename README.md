Solution of displacement vector of a projectile with the effects of gravity and drag using Physics Informed Neural Networks
## Introduction
The projectile motion in presence of gravity and drag force, is a partial differential equation in terms of the
displacement vector- s. 
Using the physics information, a neural network model can be designed such that the output of the model
i.e. displacement satisfies the PDE as well as the initial and final condition for the projectile motion. For this
model we donâ€™t require any training data thus reducing our reliance on the traditional numerical solvers. The
dataset for this problem can be generated by randomly sampling the time instances t and then converting
it to a tensor of a particular length for training.
The output of the Neural Network(NN) predicts the x and y component of displacement and using the physics information
as well as the initial condition the results are shown below-

## Training
The Neural Network architecture for the projectile motion problem constitutes an input layer of size 1, 8
hidden layers with 100 neurons per layer and an output of size 2 where it outputs the two components of
displacement.
The optimizer used to reduce the total cost of the problem is Adam with a learning rate of 0.01.

## Results
The final result can be seen in the image provided in this repository. Red curve corresponds to numerical 
solution and blue curve corresponds to the DNN output in the plot below-
